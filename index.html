        1928.11.10 ~ 2020.07.06 <br>
        Composer, music arranger, orchestrator, conductor, musician, and the producer
        </h3>
        <p>
        Ennio Morricone is one of <mark>the most influential maestri in the 20th century who is loved by numerous movie and music fans and composed the best songs that cross the border and generations.</mark> He dominated the movie industry transcending Europe and Hollywood since the 1960s. So far, he composed over 400 movies and drama music, and more than 100 classical music. His filmography includes more than 70 award-winning films with more than 400 scores for cinema and television. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Throughout his near 50 year career as a film composer, his signature ideas have included simple ideas in complex arrangements, unusual instrumentation, concrete sounds, the use of the human voice as part of the orchestra, long silences, musical gags, and single notes sustained forever.
        </p>
        <p>
        Until the early 80s, film music was based solely on orchestral performance. However, Ennio Morricone opened a new genre by melting external sounds, such as showering and whip sound, with harmonica, electric guitar, juice harp, recorder, and ocarina, ignored in Hollywood as low-class instruments. Spaghetti Western is the genre that became famous with the power of his movie. The representative works are <i>A Fistful of Dollars(1694)</i> and <i>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly(1966)</i> both directed by Sergio Leone.

            There are people who did not watch Morricone’s movie, 
            <br>
            yet there are none who never heard of his music in this civilized society.

          In 1965, Morricone joined the improvisation group Nuova Consonanza. Moving from the Westerns, he broadens his genre from Noire film that criticizes the American dream like <i>Once Upon a Time in America(1985)</i> by Sergio Leone via religious film, <i>The Mission(1986)</i> directed by Robert De Niro, to romance theme as <i>Love Affair(1994)</i> by Glenn Gordon Caron. He composed countless love themes applying baroque, gangster themes, atonal action sequences, nostalgic elegies, lyrical hymns, ominous strings, strident adventures, and an Italian hit parade of main title songs. 
          </p>
          <p>
          In November 2013, he began a world tour to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his film music career performing in various locations such as the Crocus City Hall in Moscow, Santiago, Chile, Berlin, Germany (O2 World), Budapest, Hungary, and Vienna’s Stadhalle.
